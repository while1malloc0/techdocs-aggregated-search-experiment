# Techdocs Aggregated Search Experiment

This is an experiment in aggregating different indexes generated by the techdocs-core plugin to use with a lunr.js search.

## Quickstart

Setup everything with `./scripts/setup.sh`

Run the server with `node main.js`

Search for things with `curl 'localhost:3000?q=$your-query'`

## Scenario

There are two docs folders, creatively named first-docs-repo and second-docs-repo.
Each represents the docs for a separate Backstage component.
The setup script builds the docs for each, which would be part of a CI pipeline in real file.
The express process reads the `search_index.json` file that the techdocs-core plugin builds and turns it into a lunr index that can be queried at the `/` route.
